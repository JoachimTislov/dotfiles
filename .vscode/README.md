# Vscode (vim) settings and keybindings

Use this at your own risk.

Firstly, install the [Vscode Vim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wy-z.vscode-vim-mode)

Then you could either copy parts of these config files or fork this repo and either set up symlinks for the "settings" and "keybindings" json files, or cloning it inside your Vscode User Directory. Symbolic links can be created with [mklink](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mklink) on windows and [ln](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-symbolic-links-in-linux-using-the-ln-command/) on linux.

## TODOs
